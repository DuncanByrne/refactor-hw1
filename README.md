Code Refractor HW

This repository contains the refactored code for Horiseon Solution Services.
In this code I fixed the issue with the website not being properly accessible to people with disabilities.
There were examples of this in the .jpeg and .png files provided, this was an issue because previously the website would not
have been compatible with assistive technologies for the disabled. Now that this feature is added the website


This website also contained issues within the links provided. The first link was supposed to navigate the user to the
websites Search Engine Optimization. Originally this function did not work and the link took the user nowhere. I fixed this 
by editing the semantic elements within the code
