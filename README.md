Code Refractor HW

This repository contains the refactored code for Horiseon Solution Services.
In this code I fixed the issue with the website not being properly accessible to people with disabilities.
There were examples of this in the .jpeg and .png files provided, this was an issue because previously the website would not
have been compatible with assistive technologies. Now that these changes have been made, the website will perform correctly 
for those who need screen readers, braille keyboards etc.


This website also contained issues within the links provided. Previously not all the links would lead the user to the
desired area, the "Search Engine Optimization" link in the header segment of the code provided, had not been assigned
a unique identifier or and id. Now when the link is clicked on the website, the user will be brought to the intended 
destination
